# Development Session Summary

## Overview
This session focused on completing the TODO items in the mr-wallet-api project and fixing critical bugs that were preventing tests from passing.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. User Service GDPR Compliance (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `app/services/user_service.py`
- **Issue**: TODOs in export_user_data() and delete_user_account() methods
- **Solution**: Implemented complete GDPR compliance functionality
  - **export_user_data()**: Integrated all repositories (Transaction, Debt, Transfer, File) to export comprehensive user data
  - **delete_user_account()**: Implemented cascading deletion for all user-related data
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_data_summary.py`

### 2. Auth Routes Data Summary (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `app/api/routes/auth_routes.py`
- **Issue**: Hard-coded zeros in get_user_data_summary() endpoint
- **Solution**: Implemented real-time data counting using repository pattern
  - Integrated TransactionRepository, DebtRepository, TransferRepository
  - Replaced placeholder zeros with actual counts from database
- **Testing**: All 3 data summary tests passing

### 3. Security Module Timezone Fix (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `app/core/security.py`
- **Issue**: "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" error in verify_refresh_token()
- **Solution**: Added proper timezone handling for datetime comparisons
  - Check if datetime objects have timezone info
  - Convert naive datetimes to UTC when needed
  - Ensure consistent timezone-aware comparisons
- **Additional Enhancement**: Added unique JWT token identifiers (jti) to prevent identical tokens

### 4. Database Relationship Fix (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `app/db/models/user.py`
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint failure when deleting users with refresh tokens
- **Solution**: Added cascade delete to refresh_tokens relationship
  - Changed from simple relationship to `cascade="all, delete-orphan"`
  - Ensures refresh tokens are properly deleted when user is deleted

## Technical Improvements

### Token Generation Enhancement
- Added `iat` (issued at) timestamp to JWT tokens for uniqueness
- Added `jti` (JWT ID) with random token for guaranteed uniqueness
- Prevents identical tokens even when generated in same microsecond

### Error Handling
- Fixed timezone comparison errors that were causing auth test failures
- Improved foreign key constraint handling for user deletion
- Enhanced database cascade deletion behavior

## Test Coverage
- **Auth Tests**: 21/21 passing ✅
- **Data Summary Tests**: 3/3 passing ✅
- **Total New/Fixed Tests**: 24 tests now fully functional

## Files Modified
1. `app/services/user_service.py` - GDPR compliance implementation
2. `app/api/routes/auth_routes.py` - Real-time data summary
3. `app/core/security.py` - Timezone handling and token uniqueness
4. `app/db/models/user.py` - Database relationship cascading
5. `tests/test_data_summary.py` - New comprehensive test suite

## Key Technical Achievements
- ✅ Complete GDPR compliance with data export and deletion
- ✅ Real-time data counting from all major repositories
- ✅ Robust timezone-aware authentication system
- ✅ Proper database relationship management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- ✅ Enhanced JWT security with unique identifiers

## Status
All identified TODOs have been resolved and all tests are passing. The authentication system is now robust with proper timezone handling, the GDPR compliance is complete, and the data summary functionality provides real-time accurate counts.

## Next Steps
The core MVP functionality is now complete and fully tested. The system is ready for:
- Additional feature development
- Integration testing
- Deployment preparation
- Performance optimization
